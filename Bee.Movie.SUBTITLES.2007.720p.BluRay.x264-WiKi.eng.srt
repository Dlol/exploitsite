1
00:00:58,824 --> 00:01:02,260
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

2
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:05,456
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

3
00:01:16,208 --> 00:01:19,177
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

4
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:20,576
Coming!

5
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,241
Hang on a second.

6
00:01:24,283 --> 00:01:25,272
Hello?

7
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:26,443
- Barry?
- Adam?

8
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:30,080
- Can you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

9
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,423
Looking sharp.

10
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:41,194
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

11
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,632
Sorry. I'm excited.

12
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:45,694
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

13
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:48,205
A perfect report card, all B's.

14
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,536
Very proud.

15
00:01:49,608 --> 00:01:51,473
Ma! I got a thing going here.

16
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:54,206
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

17
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,716
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

18
00:01:57,783 --> 00:02:00,343
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

19
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,071
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

20
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:27,544
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

21
00:02:27,613 --> 00:02:29,012
Never thought I'd make it.

22
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:31,572
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

23
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,844
Those were awkward.

24
00:02:32,918 --> 00:02:37,082
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

25
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:38,919
You did come back different.

26
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,655
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

27
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,359
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

28
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:48,298
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

29
00:02:48,367 --> 00:02:50,562
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

30
00:02:50,636 --> 00:02:53,230
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

31
00:02:53,305 --> 00:02:55,830
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

32
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,978
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

33
00:03:07,052 --> 00:03:09,316
That's why we don't need vacations.

34
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:19,291
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

35
00:03:22,968 --> 00:03:25,232
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

36
00:03:25,304 --> 00:03:26,737
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

37
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:28,137
Hallelujah!

38
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:32,073
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

39
00:03:32,144 --> 00:03:35,136
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

40
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:40,443
Welcome, New Hive City
graduating class of...

41
00:03:41,153 --> 00:03:42,814
.15.

42
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:45,783
That concludes our ceremonies.

43
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:51,693
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

44
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,322
Will we pick our job today?

45
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,264
I heard it's just orientation.

46
00:03:55,334 --> 00:03:57,325
Heads up! Here we go.

47
00:03:58,737 --> 00:04:02,173
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

48
00:04:11,016 --> 00:04:14,008
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

49
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,618
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

50
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:21,524
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

51
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,027
This is it!

52
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,591
Wow.

53
00:04:31,637 --> 00:04:32,797
Wow.

54
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,807
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

55
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:40,175
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

56
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:44,876
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

57
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,713
Our top-secret formula

58
00:04:46,785 --> 00:04:50,983
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

59
00:04:51,056 --> 00:04:53,650
into this soothing sweet syrup

60
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:57,662
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

61
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,891
Honey!

62
00:05:02,234 --> 00:05:04,668
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

63
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:06,932
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

64
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:10,737
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

65
00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:13,937
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

66
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:17,608
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

67
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:36,190
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

68
00:05:36,268 --> 00:05:39,795
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

69
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:43,103
- What does that do?
- Catches that little strand of honey

70
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:46,372
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

71
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:50,939
Can anyone work on the Krelman?

72
00:05:51,016 --> 00:05:55,043
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

73
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,851
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

74
00:05:58,924 --> 00:06:00,824
But choose carefully

75
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:05,592
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

76
00:06:06,598 --> 00:06:09,726
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

77
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,531
What's the difference?

78
00:06:12,504 --> 00:06:16,964
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

79
00:06:17,042 --> 00:06:19,533
in 27 million years.

80
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,313
So you'll just work us to death?

81
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:23,609
We'll sure try.

82
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,559
Wow! That blew my mind!

83
00:06:45,904 --> 00:06:48,429
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?

84
00:06:48,507 --> 00:06:51,840
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

85
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:55,243
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

86
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:58,340
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

87
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:00,908
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

88
00:07:00,986 --> 00:07:03,978
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

89
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:09,586
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

90
00:07:09,661 --> 00:07:11,652
Like what? Give me one example.

91
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,862
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

92
00:07:21,273 --> 00:07:24,367
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

93
00:07:24,443 --> 00:07:26,308
Wait a second. Check it out.

94
00:07:26,378 --> 00:07:28,676
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

95
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,384
I've never seen them this close.

96
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:44,793
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

97
00:07:44,863 --> 00:07:46,626
Yeah, but some don't come back.

98
00:07:46,698 --> 00:07:48,290
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

99
00:08:11,323 --> 00:08:13,416
You guys did great!

100
00:08:13,492 --> 00:08:17,929
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

101
00:08:17,996 --> 00:08:20,430
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

102
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:21,932
Their day's not planned.

103
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,527
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

104
00:08:25,604 --> 00:08:29,597
You can't just decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

105
00:08:30,008 --> 00:08:31,339
Right.

106
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:36,212
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

107
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:39,773
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

108
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:45,552
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

109
00:08:45,624 --> 00:08:48,286
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

110
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,021
Distant. Distant.

111
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:52,427
Look at these two.

112
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:55,467
- Couple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

113
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:57,866
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

114
00:08:57,936 --> 00:09:00,962
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

115
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:04,668
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

116
00:09:04,743 --> 00:09:07,234
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

117
00:09:07,312 --> 00:09:09,246
What were you doing during this?

118
00:09:09,314 --> 00:09:11,043
Trying to alert the authorities.

119
00:09:11,116 --> 00:09:12,811
I can autograph that.

120
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,820
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

121
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,150
Yeah. Gusty.

122
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:20,680
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

123
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:22,283
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!

124
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:25,797
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

125
00:09:25,864 --> 00:09:27,798
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!

126
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:30,460
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

127
00:09:32,037 --> 00:09:35,131
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

128
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,604
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

129
00:09:49,054 --> 00:09:50,385
Hey, Honex!

130
00:09:50,455 --> 00:09:52,719
Dad, you surprised me.

131
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,055
You decide what you're interested in?

132
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:58,290
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.

133
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:01,727
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

134
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,791
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

135
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:07,737
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

136
00:10:07,806 --> 00:10:11,173
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

137
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,575
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,

138
00:10:13,645 --> 00:10:17,046
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.

139
00:10:17,115 --> 00:10:19,879
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?

140
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,352
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.

141
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:25,652
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

142
00:10:25,724 --> 00:10:29,717
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

143
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:33,287
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

144
00:10:33,365 --> 00:10:36,266
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!

145
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,064
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

146
00:10:38,136 --> 00:10:41,230
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

147
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:43,331
Let's open some honey and celebrate!

148
00:10:43,408 --> 00:10:46,502
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

149
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:50,947
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!

150
00:10:51,016 --> 00:10:52,415
I'm so proud.

151
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:02,185
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.

152
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,422
Come on! All the good jobs
will be gone.

153
00:11:04,496 --> 00:11:05,861
Yeah, right.

154
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:10,732
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

155
00:11:10,802 --> 00:11:13,896
- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!

156
00:11:13,972 --> 00:11:16,873
One of them's yours! Congratulations!
Step to the side.

157
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:20,034
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!

158
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:21,272
Wow!

159
00:11:21,346 --> 00:11:22,711
Couple of newbies?

160
00:11:22,781 --> 00:11:25,215
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

161
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:26,512
Make your choice.

162
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,884
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.

163
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:32,719
Oh, my. What's available?

164
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:35,760
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.

165
00:11:35,827 --> 00:11:39,763
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.

166
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:43,260
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

167
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:44,859
Wax monkey's always open.

168
00:11:45,737 --> 00:11:48,001
The Krelman opened up again.

169
00:11:48,073 --> 00:11:49,062
What happened?

170
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:52,736
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.

171
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:54,642
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

172
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:58,080
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!

173
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,311
Oh, this is so hard!

174
00:12:01,186 --> 00:12:03,654
Heating, cooling,
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,

175
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:07,954
humming, inspector number seven,
lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,

176
00:12:08,026 --> 00:12:11,427
mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?

177
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,161
Barry!

178
00:12:13,965 --> 00:12:17,799
All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...

179
00:12:17,869 --> 00:12:19,700
What happened to you?
Where are you?

180
00:12:19,771 --> 00:12:22,137
- I'm going out.
- Out? Out where?

181
00:12:22,207 --> 00:12:23,799
- Out there.
- Oh, no!

182
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,571
I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.

183
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:29,136
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?

184
00:12:29,214 --> 00:12:30,875
Another call coming in.

185
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:35,646
If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd

186
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:38,155
that gets their roses today.

187
00:12:38,223 --> 00:12:39,383
Hey, guys.

188
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:42,655
- Look at that.
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?

189
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,992
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.

190
00:12:45,063 --> 00:12:47,156
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.

191
00:12:47,232 --> 00:12:49,132
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?

192
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:52,670
Sign here, here. Just initial that.

193
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:54,262
- Thank you.
- OK.

194
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:56,170
You got a rain advisory today,

195
00:12:56,241 --> 00:13:00,302
and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain.

196
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:03,007
So be careful. As always,
watch your brooms,

197
00:13:03,248 --> 00:13:06,740
hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.

198
00:13:06,818 --> 00:13:10,686
Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.

199
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:15,420
Murphy's in a home because of it,
babbling like a cicada!

200
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:18,458
- That's awful.
- And a reminder for you rookies,

201
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:22,523
bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!

202
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,762
All right, launch positions!

203
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:30,772
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!

204
00:13:31,943 --> 00:13:33,535
Black and yellow!

205
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:34,772
Hello!

206
00:13:36,181 --> 00:13:38,081
You ready for this, hot shot?

207
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,981
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.

208
00:13:40,051 --> 00:13:41,541
Wind, check.

209
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,645
- Antennae, check.
- Nectar pack, check.

210
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:46,213
- Wings, check.
- Stinger, check.

211
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,259
Scared out of my shorts, check.

212
00:13:48,326 --> 00:13:50,385
OK, ladies,

213
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,293
let's move it out!

214
00:14:01,306 --> 00:14:05,640
Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!

215
00:14:05,977 --> 00:14:10,243
All of you, drain those flowers!

216
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:28,999
Wow! I'm out!

217
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,662
I can't believe I'm out!

218
00:14:33,338 --> 00:14:34,999
So blue.

219
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,512
I feel so fast and free!

220
00:14:46,017 --> 00:14:47,348
Box kite!

221
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,012
Wow!

222
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,361
Flowers!

223
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:14,910
This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.

224
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,005
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.

225
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,106
Roses!

226
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:20,981
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.

227
00:15:32,397 --> 00:15:35,161
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.

228
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,169
That is one nectar collector!

229
00:15:45,143 --> 00:15:47,373
- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.

230
00:15:47,612 --> 00:15:52,242
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Maybe a dash over there,

231
00:15:52,317 --> 00:15:55,616
a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.

232
00:15:55,887 --> 00:15:58,412
That's amazing. Why do we do that?

233
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:03,325
That's pollen power. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.

234
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:04,521
Cool.

235
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,846
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
Could be daisies. Don't we need those?

236
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:32,183
Copy that visual.

237
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,919
Wait. One of these flowers
seems to be on the move.

238
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:37,518
Say again? You're reporting
a moving flower?

239
00:16:37,762 --> 00:16:39,093
Affirmative.

240
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,206
That was on the line!

241
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:53,870
This is the coolest. What is it?

242
00:16:53,945 --> 00:16:56,539
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.

243
00:16:56,615 --> 00:17:00,711
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.

244
00:17:00,785 --> 00:17:02,377
Yeah, fuzzy.

245
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:04,217
Chemical-y.

246
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,450
Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.

247
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:09,719
My sweet lord of bees!

248
00:17:09,794 --> 00:17:11,785
Candy-brain, get off there!

249
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,620
Problem!

250
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,302
- Guys!
- This could be bad.

251
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,564
Affirmative.

252
00:17:20,138 --> 00:17:21,469
Very close.

253
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:23,805
Gonna hurt.

254
00:17:24,976 --> 00:17:26,170
Mama's little boy.

255
00:17:26,244 --> 00:17:28,144
You are way out of position, rookie!

256
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:33,481
Coming in at you like a missile!

257
00:17:36,821 --> 00:17:39,051
Help me!

258
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,323
I don't think these are flowers.

259
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,919
- Should we tell him?
- I think he knows.

260
00:17:44,996 --> 00:17:46,327
What is this?!

261
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:52,434
Match point!

262
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:57,498
You can start packing up, honey,
because you're about to eat it!

263
00:18:06,184 --> 00:18:07,515
Yowser!

264
00:18:36,147 --> 00:18:37,341
Gross.

265
00:18:43,154 --> 00:18:45,054
There's a bee in the car!

266
00:18:46,991 --> 00:18:48,618
- Do something!
- I'm driving!

267
00:18:48,693 --> 00:18:50,524
- Hi, bee.
- He's back here!

268
00:18:50,595 --> 00:18:52,324
He's going to sting me!

269
00:19:00,238 --> 00:19:04,834
Nobody move. If you don't move,
he won't sting you. Freeze!

270
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,343
He blinked!

271
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:08,436
Spray him, Granny!

272
00:19:08,513 --> 00:19:10,003
What are you doing?!

273
00:19:18,089 --> 00:19:21,752
Wow... the tension level
out here is unbelievable.

274
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,084
I gotta get home.

275
00:19:33,838 --> 00:19:38,531
Can't fly in rain.

276
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,611
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!

277
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:56,226
Ken, could you close
the window please?

278
00:19:56,294 --> 00:19:59,957
Check out my new résumé.
I made it into a fold-out brochure.

279
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:01,828
You see? Folds out.

280
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,300
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.

281
00:20:07,138 --> 00:20:08,969
What was that?

282
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,635
Maybe this time. This time. This time.
This time! This time! This...

283
00:20:12,977 --> 00:20:14,672
Drapes!

284
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,737
That is diabolical.

285
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:21,752
It's fantastic. It's got all my special
skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.

286
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,685
What's number one? Star Wars?

287
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,222
Nah, I don't go for that...

288
00:20:27,158 --> 00:20:28,489
...kind of stuff.

289
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,495
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
They're out of their minds.

290
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:35,795
When I leave a job interview, they're
flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.

291
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:38,995
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.

292
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:42,564
I don't remember the sun
having a big 75 on it.

293
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,775
I predicted global warming.

294
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:54,682
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.

295
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:58,015
Wait! Stop! Bee!

296
00:21:00,024 --> 00:21:02,925
Stand back. These are winter boots.

297
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:06,786
Wait!

298
00:21:07,198 --> 00:21:08,392
Don't kill him!

299
00:21:08,466 --> 00:21:11,526
You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!

300
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:14,367
Why does his life have
less value than yours?

301
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:19,970
Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?

302
00:21:20,044 --> 00:21:25,038
I'm just saying all life has value. You
don't know what he's capable of feeling.

303
00:21:27,051 --> 00:21:28,541
My brochure!

304
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:44,728
There you go, little guy.

305
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,638
I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.

306
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:54,177
Put that on your résumé brochure.

307
00:21:54,245 --> 00:21:56,179
My whole face could puff up.

308
00:21:56,247 --> 00:21:58,238
Make it one of your special skills.

309
00:21:58,316 --> 00:22:01,649
Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.

310
00:22:04,422 --> 00:22:06,356
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.

311
00:22:06,424 --> 00:22:10,019
- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.

312
00:22:10,094 --> 00:22:12,255
- You could put carob chips on there.
- Bye.

313
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,594
- Supposed to be less calories.
- Bye.

314
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,563
I gotta say something.

315
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:26,332
She saved my life.
I gotta say something.

316
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:29,341
All right, here it goes.

317
00:22:41,292 --> 00:22:42,452
Nah.

318
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:50,798
What would I say?

319
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:55,632
I could really get in trouble.

320
00:22:57,575 --> 00:23:00,908
It's a bee law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.

321
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,810
I can't believe I'm doing this.

322
00:23:03,481 --> 00:23:04,971
I've got to.

323
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:07,313
Oh, I can't do it. Come on!

324
00:23:08,486 --> 00:23:10,249
No. Yes. No.

325
00:23:10,321 --> 00:23:12,312
Do it. I can't.

326
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:16,885
How should I start it?
"You like jazz?" No, that's no good.

327
00:23:16,961 --> 00:23:20,089
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!

328
00:23:20,164 --> 00:23:21,927
Hi!

329
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,592
I'm sorry.

330
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:26,102
- You're talking.
- Yes, I know.

331
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,432
You're talking!

332
00:23:27,505 --> 00:23:28,836
I'm so sorry.

333
00:23:28,906 --> 00:23:32,103
No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming.

334
00:23:32,176 --> 00:23:34,303
But I don't recall going to bed.

335
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:37,473
Well, I'm sure this
is very disconcerting.

336
00:23:37,548 --> 00:23:42,349
This is a bit of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a bee!

337
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,981
I am. And I'm not supposed
to be doing this,

338
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,116
but they were all trying to kill me.

339
00:23:48,192 --> 00:23:50,524
And if it wasn't for you...

340
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,995
I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.

341
00:23:55,566 --> 00:23:57,261
That was a little weird.

342
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:59,326
- I'm talking with a bee.
- Yeah.

343
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:03,170
I'm talking to a bee.
And the bee is talking to me!

344
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:06,039
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.

345
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:09,443
- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
- What?

346
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:11,982
The talking thing.

347
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:16,316
Same way you did, I guess.
"Mama, Dada, honey. " You pick it up.

348
00:24:16,387 --> 00:24:17,820
- That's very funny.
- Yeah.

349
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:22,189
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.

350
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,318
Anyway...

351
00:24:23,394 --> 00:24:24,691
Can I...

352
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:27,194
- ... get you something?
- Like what?

353
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:31,668
I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Coffee?

354
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:34,068
I don't want to put you out.

355
00:24:34,138 --> 00:24:36,402
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.

356
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:38,533
- It's just coffee.
- I hate to impose.

357
00:24:38,609 --> 00:24:41,669
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Actually, I would love a cup.

358
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:43,043
Hey, you want rum cake?

359
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:44,547
- I shouldn't.
- Have some.

360
00:24:44,615 --> 00:24:46,879
- No, I can't.
- Come on!

361
00:24:46,951 --> 00:24:49,146
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.

362
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,051
- Where?
- These stripes don't help.

363
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:52,214
You look great!

364
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,986
I don't know if you know
anything about fashion.

365
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:56,282
Are you all right?

366
00:24:56,794 --> 00:24:58,125
No.

367
00:24:59,797 --> 00:25:03,995
He's making the tie in the cab
as they're flying up Madison.

368
00:25:04,068 --> 00:25:06,002
He finally gets there.

369
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:09,733
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.

370
00:25:09,807 --> 00:25:13,903
And he says, "Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.

371
00:25:13,978 --> 00:25:16,208
Why would I marry a watermelon?"

372
00:25:21,819 --> 00:25:24,617
Is that a bee joke?

373
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,213
That's the kind of stuff we do.

374
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:28,258
Yeah, different.

375
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:31,352
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?

376
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:33,420
About work? I don't know.

377
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:37,958
I want to do my part for the hive,
but I can't do it the way they want.

378
00:25:38,035 --> 00:25:39,366
I know how you feel.

379
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:41,371
- You do?
- Sure.

380
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:45,899
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.

381
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:48,775
- Really?
- My only interest is flowers.

382
00:25:48,846 --> 00:25:52,509
Our new queen was just elected
with that same campaign slogan.

383
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:56,113
Anyway, if you look...

384
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:58,951
There's my hive right there. See it?

385
00:25:59,023 --> 00:26:00,718
You're in Sheep Meadow!

386
00:26:00,791 --> 00:26:03,453
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!

387
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:08,295
No way! I know that area.
I lost a toe ring there once.

388
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:11,199
- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
- Why not?

389
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:14,727
- It's like putting a hat on your knee.
- Maybe I'll try that.

390
00:26:14,805 --> 00:26:18,536
- You all right, ma'am?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.

391
00:26:18,609 --> 00:26:20,839
Just having two cups of coffee!

392
00:26:33,691 --> 00:26:36,717
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.

393
00:26:36,794 --> 00:26:37,988
Yeah, it's no trouble.

394
00:26:38,062 --> 00:26:41,896
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
I'd be up the rest of my life.

395
00:26:42,366 --> 00:26:43,560
Are you...?

396
00:26:44,368 --> 00:26:47,269
Can I take a piece of this with me?

397
00:26:47,338 --> 00:26:50,364
Sure! Here, have a crumb.

398
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:53,772
- Thanks!
- Yeah.

399
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:58,144
All right. Well, then...
I guess I'll see you around.

400
00:26:58,216 --> 00:26:59,706
Or not.

401
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:01,678
OK, Barry.

402
00:27:01,752 --> 00:27:04,744
And thank you
so much again... for before.

403
00:27:04,822 --> 00:27:06,790
Oh, that? That was nothing.

404
00:27:06,857 --> 00:27:09,587
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...

405
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,646
This can't possibly work.

406
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:35,311
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.

407
00:27:35,386 --> 00:27:37,650
OK, Dave, pull the chute.

408
00:27:41,058 --> 00:27:42,923
- Sounds amazing.
- It was amazing!

409
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,929
It was the scariest,
happiest moment of my life.

410
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,591
Humans! I can't believe
you were with humans!

411
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:51,260
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?

412
00:27:51,335 --> 00:27:53,496
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.

413
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:56,335
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.

414
00:27:56,407 --> 00:28:00,241
- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
- Some of them. But some of them don't.

415
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:01,869
- How'd you get back?
- Poodle.

416
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:06,110
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
whatever you wanted to see.

417
00:28:06,183 --> 00:28:10,620
You had your "experience. " Now you
can pick out your job and be normal.

418
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:12,349
- Well...
- Well?

419
00:28:12,423 --> 00:28:13,720
Well, I met someone.

420
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:16,123
You did? Was she Bee-ish?

421
00:28:16,193 --> 00:28:19,458
- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
- No, no, no, not a wasp.

422
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,862
- Spider?
- I'm not attracted to spiders.

423
00:28:21,932 --> 00:28:25,129
I know it's the hottest thing,
with the eight legs and all.

424
00:28:25,202 --> 00:28:26,533
I can't get by that face.

425
00:28:27,204 --> 00:28:29,229
So who is she?

426
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:32,367
She's... human.

427
00:28:32,443 --> 00:28:36,311
No, no. That's a bee law.
You wouldn't break a bee law.

428
00:28:36,547 --> 00:28:38,481
- Her name's Vanessa.
- Oh, boy.

429
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:41,484
She's so nice. And she's a florist!

430
00:28:41,552 --> 00:28:44,316
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!

431
00:28:44,555 --> 00:28:45,920
We're not dating.

432
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:50,051
You're flying outside the hive, talking
to humans that attack our homes

433
00:28:50,127 --> 00:28:53,756
with power washers and M-80s!
One-eighth a stick of dynamite!

434
00:28:53,831 --> 00:28:57,824
She saved my life!
And she understands me.

435
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,062
This is over!

436
00:28:59,136 --> 00:29:00,626
Eat this.

437
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:03,401
This is not over! What was that?

438
00:29:03,474 --> 00:29:05,942
- They call it a crumb.
- It was so stingin' stripey!

439
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:09,502
And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!

440
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,514
- You know what a Cinnabon is?
- No.

441
00:29:11,582 --> 00:29:14,949
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
They heat it up...

442
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:16,077
Sit down!

443
00:29:16,153 --> 00:29:18,087
- ... really hot!
- Listen to me!

444
00:29:18,155 --> 00:29:22,182
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!

445
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:25,524
Yes, but who can deny
the heart that is yearning?

446
00:29:25,596 --> 00:29:28,360
There's no yearning.
Stop yearning. Listen to me!

447
00:29:28,432 --> 00:29:32,698
You have got to start thinking bee,
my friend. Thinking bee!

448
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,533
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

449
00:29:34,605 --> 00:29:38,974
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

450
00:29:40,511 --> 00:29:42,706
There he is. He's in the pool.

451
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,180
You know what your problem is, Barry?

452
00:29:45,249 --> 00:29:47,274
I gotta start thinking bee?

453
00:29:47,351 --> 00:29:49,285
How much longer will this go on?

454
00:29:49,353 --> 00:29:52,345
It's been three days!
Why aren't you working?

455
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:55,187
I've got a lot of big life decisions
to think about.

456
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:59,491
What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!

457
00:29:59,563 --> 00:30:01,997
Would it kill you
to make a little honey?

458
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:04,933
Barry, come out.
Your father's talking to you.

459
00:30:05,002 --> 00:30:06,867
Martin, would you talk to him?

460
00:30:06,937 --> 00:30:08,632
Barry, I'm talking to you!

461
00:30:36,834 --> 00:30:38,426
You coming?

462
00:30:38,502 --> 00:30:40,333
Got everything?

463
00:30:40,671 --> 00:30:42,502
All set!

464
00:30:42,573 --> 00:30:43,904
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

465
00:30:43,974 --> 00:30:45,566
Don't be too long.

466
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,352
Watch this!

467
00:31:13,704 --> 00:31:15,365
Vanessa!

468
00:31:18,175 --> 00:31:20,973
- We're still here.
- I told you not to yell at him.

469
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,138
He doesn't respond to yelling!

470
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,375
- Then why yell at me?
- Because you don't listen!

471
00:31:25,449 --> 00:31:27,076
I'm not listening to this.

472
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:28,311
Sorry, I've gotta go.

473
00:31:28,385 --> 00:31:30,819
- Where are you going?
- I'm meeting a friend.

474
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:33,618
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?

475
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:34,783
Bye.

476
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:37,123
I just hope she's Bee-ish.

477
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:44,566
They have a huge parade
of flowers every year in Pasadena?

478
00:31:44,635 --> 00:31:49,163
To be in the Tournament of Roses,
that's every florist's dream!

479
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,677
Up on a float, surrounded
by flowers, crowds cheering.

480
00:31:53,744 --> 00:31:57,145
A tournament. Do the roses
compete in athletic events?

481
00:31:57,581 --> 00:32:02,018
No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?

482
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:05,351
It's exhausting. Why don't you
run everywhere? It's faster.

483
00:32:05,422 --> 00:32:08,186
Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.

484
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:11,695
iVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That's insane!

485
00:32:11,762 --> 00:32:13,423
You don't have that?

486
00:32:13,497 --> 00:32:17,433
We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
It's a horrible, horrible disease.

487
00:32:17,501 --> 00:32:18,832
Oh, my.

488
00:32:19,503 --> 00:32:21,027
Dumb bees!

489
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:24,336
You must want to sting all those jerks.

490
00:32:24,408 --> 00:32:27,468
We try not to sting.
It's usually fatal for us.

491
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:30,036
So you have to watch your temper.

492
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:33,447
Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk,

493
00:32:33,517 --> 00:32:37,453
write an angry letter and throw it out.
Work through it like any emotion:

494
00:32:37,521 --> 00:32:41,082
Anger, jealousy, lust.

495
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:44,325
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?

496
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:45,623
Yeah.

497
00:32:45,696 --> 00:32:47,994
- What is wrong with you?!
- It's a bug.

498
00:32:48,065 --> 00:32:52,502
He's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!

499
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,800
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?

500
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:57,170
Yeah, it was. How did you know?

501
00:32:57,241 --> 00:33:01,143
It felt like about 10 pages.
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.

502
00:33:01,211 --> 00:33:03,304
You've really got that
down to a science.

503
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,372
- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
- I'll bet.

504
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:09,977
What in the name
of Mighty Hercules is this?

505
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:13,421
How did this get here?
Cute Bee, Golden Blossom,

506
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,425
Ray Liotta Private Select?

507
00:33:16,994 --> 00:33:19,360
- Is he that actor?
- I never heard of him.

508
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:22,263
- Why is this here?
- For people. We eat it.

509
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,426
You don't have
enough food of your own?

510
00:33:24,501 --> 00:33:27,095
- Well, yes.
- How do you get it?

511
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:30,004
- Bees make it.
- I know who makes it!

512
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:31,939
And it's hard to make it!

513
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:35,775
There's heating, cooling, stirring.
You need a whole Krelman thing!

514
00:33:35,846 --> 00:33:38,144
- It's organic.
- It's our-ganic!

515
00:33:38,215 --> 00:33:39,546
It's just honey, Barry.

516
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:41,209
Just what?!

517
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:44,948
Bees don't know about this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!

518
00:33:45,022 --> 00:33:48,958
You've taken our homes, schools,
hospitals! This is all we have!

519
00:33:49,793 --> 00:33:52,660
And it's on sale?!
I'm getting to the bottom of this.

520
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,960
I'm getting to the bottom
of all of this!

521
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:03,129
Hey, Hector.

522
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:07,641
- You almost done?
- Almost.

523
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,210
He is here. I sense it.

524
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:23,259
Well, I guess I'll go home now

525
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:27,593
and just leave this nice honey out,
with no one around.

526
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:29,496
You're busted, box boy!

527
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:33,163
I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!

528
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:36,104
I can talk.
And now you'll start talking!

529
00:34:36,173 --> 00:34:39,267
Where you getting the sweet stuff?
Who's your supplier?

530
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:41,937
I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.

531
00:34:42,012 --> 00:34:44,674
The last thing we want
to do is upset bees!

532
00:34:45,182 --> 00:34:47,776
You're too late! It's ours now!

533
00:34:47,851 --> 00:34:50,445
You, sir, have crossed
the wrong sword!

534
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:53,854
You, sir, will be lunch
for my iguana, Ignacio!

535
00:34:53,924 --> 00:34:56,017
Where is the honey coming from?

536
00:34:57,861 --> 00:34:59,556
Tell me where!

537
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,155
Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!

538
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:26,815
Crazy person!

539
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:05,190
What horrible thing has happened here?

540
00:36:05,262 --> 00:36:08,663
These faces, they never knew
what hit them. And now

541
00:36:08,732 --> 00:36:11,462
they're on the road to nowhere!

542
00:36:11,535 --> 00:36:13,264
Just keep still.

543
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,861
What? You're not dead?

544
00:36:15,105 --> 00:36:19,007
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
that moves. Where you headed?

545
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:22,102
To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.

546
00:36:22,179 --> 00:36:26,548
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
crazy stuff. Blows your head off!

547
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:28,551
I'm going to Tacoma.

548
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:30,712
- And you?
- He really is dead.

549
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:32,050
All right.

550
00:36:32,122 --> 00:36:33,316
Uh-oh!

551
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,358
- What is that?!
- Oh, no!

552
00:36:35,425 --> 00:36:37,416
- A wiper! Triple blade!
- Triple blade?

553
00:36:37,494 --> 00:36:40,156
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!

554
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:44,496
Why does everything have
to be so doggone clean?!

555
00:36:44,568 --> 00:36:46,729
How much do you people need to see?!

556
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:49,864
Open your eyes!
Stick your head out the window!

557
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:53,137
From NPR News in Washington,
I'm Carl Kasell.

558
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,770
But don't kill no more bugs!

559
00:36:58,115 --> 00:37:00,606
- Bee!
- Moose blood guy!

560
00:37:09,593 --> 00:37:11,390
- You hear something?
- Like what?

561
00:37:11,461 --> 00:37:12,792
Like tiny screaming.

562
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,361
Turn off the radio.

563
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:28,168
Whassup, bee boy?

564
00:37:28,245 --> 00:37:29,974
Hey, Blood.

565
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:33,244
Just a row of honey jars,
as far as the eye could see.

566
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:34,511
Wow!

567
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:38,248
I assume wherever this truck goes
is where they're getting it.

568
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:39,755
I mean, that honey's ours.

569
00:37:39,823 --> 00:37:42,087
- Bees hang tight.
- We're all jammed in.

570
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,751
It's a close community.

571
00:37:43,827 --> 00:37:47,820
Not us, man. We on our own.
Every mosquito on his own.

572
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:51,425
- What if you get in trouble?
- You a mosquito, you in trouble.

573
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:54,937
Nobody likes us. They just smack.
See a mosquito, smack, smack!

574
00:37:55,005 --> 00:37:57,974
At least you're out in the world.
You must meet girls.

575
00:37:58,041 --> 00:38:02,307
Mosquito girls try to trade up,
get with a moth, dragonfly.

576
00:38:02,379 --> 00:38:04,506
Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.

577
00:38:05,649 --> 00:38:08,174
You got to be kidding me!

578
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:11,653
Mooseblood's about to leave
the building! So long, bee!

579
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,550
- Hey, guys!
- Mooseblood!

580
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:18,227
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you bring your crazy straw?

581
00:38:34,411 --> 00:38:38,507
We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
and it's pretty much pure profit.

582
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:40,106
What is this place?

583
00:38:40,183 --> 00:38:42,583
A bee's got a brain
the size of a pinhead.

584
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,143
They are pinheads!

585
00:38:45,422 --> 00:38:46,753
Pinhead.

586
00:38:47,424 --> 00:38:50,951
- Check out the new smoker.
- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.

587
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:52,620
The Thomas 3000!

588
00:38:52,696 --> 00:38:53,720
Smoker?

589
00:38:53,797 --> 00:38:58,700
Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
Twice the nicotine, all the tar.

590
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:02,770
A couple breaths of this
knocks them right out.

591
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:08,776
They make the honey,
and we make the money.

592
00:39:08,845 --> 00:39:11,370
"They make the honey,
and we make the money"?

593
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:33,392
Oh, my!

594
00:39:36,139 --> 00:39:38,300
What's going on? Are you OK?

595
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:40,605
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.

596
00:39:40,677 --> 00:39:44,579
Do you know you're
in a fake hive with fake walls?

597
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:47,014
Our queen was moved here.
We had no choice.

598
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:50,781
This is your queen?
That's a man in women's clothes!

599
00:39:50,854 --> 00:39:52,822
That's a drag queen!

600
00:39:57,327 --> 00:39:59,158
What is this?

601
00:40:07,904 --> 00:40:09,132
Oh, no!

602
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:10,833
There's hundreds of them!

603
00:40:21,351 --> 00:40:23,012
Bee honey.

604
00:40:23,086 --> 00:40:27,455
Our honey is being brazenly stolen
on a massive scale!

605
00:40:27,524 --> 00:40:31,722
This is worse than anything bears
have done! I intend to do something.

606
00:40:31,795 --> 00:40:32,887
Oh, Barry, stop.

607
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:36,057
Who told you humans are taking
our honey? That's a rumor.

608
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:38,124
Do these look like rumors?

609
00:40:38,201 --> 00:40:41,864
That's a conspiracy theory.
These are obviously doctored photos.

610
00:40:41,938 --> 00:40:44,133
How did you get mixed up in this?

611
00:40:44,207 --> 00:40:45,731
He's been talking to humans.

612
00:40:45,809 --> 00:40:47,538
- What?
- Talking to humans?!

613
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,478
He has a human girlfriend.
And they make out!

614
00:40:50,547 --> 00:40:52,071
Make out? Barry!

615
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:53,309
We do not.

616
00:40:53,383 --> 00:40:55,578
- You wish you could.
- Whose side are you on?

617
00:40:55,652 --> 00:40:56,880
The bees!

618
00:40:56,953 --> 00:41:01,754
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
Those crazy legs kept me up all night.

619
00:41:01,825 --> 00:41:04,555
Barry, this is what you want
to do with your life?

620
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:08,359
I want to do it for all our lives.
Nobody works harder than bees!

621
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:10,923
Dad, I remember you
coming home so overworked

622
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:14,061
your hands were still stirring.
You couldn't stop.

623
00:41:14,137 --> 00:41:15,661
I remember that.

624
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:18,173
What right do they have to our honey?

625
00:41:18,241 --> 00:41:22,234
We live on two cups a year. They put it
in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!

626
00:41:22,312 --> 00:41:25,008
Even if it's true, what can one bee do?

627
00:41:25,082 --> 00:41:26,845
Sting them where it really hurts.

628
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:28,179
In the face! The eye!

629
00:41:28,251 --> 00:41:29,479
- That would hurt.
- No.

630
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:31,282
Up the nose? That's a killer.

631
00:41:31,354 --> 00:41:35,984
There's only one place you can sting
the humans, one place where it matters.

632
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:40,928
Hive at Five, the hive's only
full-hour action news source.

633
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:46,929
No more bee beards!

634
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:51,934
With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.

635
00:41:52,275 --> 00:41:53,936
Weather with Storm Stinger.

636
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:55,542
Sports with Buzz Larvi.

637
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:57,770
And Jeanette Chung.

638
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:03,078
- Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
- And I'm Jeanette Chung.

639
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:05,553
A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,

640
00:42:05,622 --> 00:42:09,217
intends to sue the human race
for stealing our honey,

641
00:42:09,292 --> 00:42:12,022
packaging it and profiting
from it illegally!

642
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:17,627
Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,

643
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:22,365
we'll have three former queens here in
our studio, discussing their new book,

644
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:25,897
Classy Ladies,
out this week on Hexagon.

645
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:28,137
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.

646
00:42:28,211 --> 00:42:31,647
Did you ever think, "I'm a kid
from the hive. I can't do this"?

647
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,309
Bees have never been afraid
to change the world.

648
00:42:34,384 --> 00:42:37,649
What about Bee Columbus?
Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?

649
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,246
Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.

650
00:42:40,323 --> 00:42:43,417
We were thinking
of stickball or candy stores.

651
00:42:43,493 --> 00:42:44,858
How old are you?

652
00:42:44,928 --> 00:42:48,261
The bee community
is supporting you in this case,

653
00:42:48,331 --> 00:42:51,164
which will be the trial
of the bee century.

654
00:42:51,234 --> 00:42:54,260
You know, they have a Larry King
in the human world too.

655
00:42:54,337 --> 00:42:56,669
It's a common name. Next week...

656
00:42:57,007 --> 00:43:01,671
He looks like you and has a show
and suspenders and colored dots...

657
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,269
Next week...

658
00:43:03,346 --> 00:43:07,680
Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the
guest even though you just heard 'em.

659
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:11,778
Bear Week next week!
They're scary, hairy and here live.

660
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:16,952
Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
squinty eyes, very Jewish.

661
00:43:18,528 --> 00:43:23,056
In tennis, you attack
at the point of weakness!

662
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:26,967
It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.

663
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:30,700
Honey, her backhand's a joke!
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?

664
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:33,470
Quiet, please.
Actual work going on here.

665
00:43:33,543 --> 00:43:36,808
- Is that that same bee?
- Yes, it is!

666
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,542
I'm helping him sue the human race.

667
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:42,815
- Hello.
- Hello, bee.

668
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:44,148
This is Ken.

669
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:49,318
Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size
ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.

670
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:51,724
Why does he talk again?

671
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,730
Listen, you better go
'cause we're really busy working.

672
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,993
But it's our yogurt night!

673
00:43:57,067 --> 00:43:58,398
Bye-bye.

674
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:02,004
Why is yogurt night so difficult?!

675
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:06,941
You poor thing.
You two have been at this for hours!

676
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:09,240
Yes, and Adam here
has been a huge help.

677
00:44:10,413 --> 00:44:12,779
- Frosting...
- How many sugars?

678
00:44:12,849 --> 00:44:15,079
Just one. I try not
to use the competition.

679
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:18,552
So why are you helping me?

680
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:20,487
Bees have good qualities.

681
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:24,353
And it takes my mind off the shop.

682
00:44:24,427 --> 00:44:28,557
Instead of flowers, people
are giving balloon bouquets now.

683
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:31,032
Those are great, if you're three.

684
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:32,659
And artificial flowers.

685
00:44:32,736 --> 00:44:36,695
- Oh, those just get me psychotic!
- Yeah, me too.

686
00:44:36,773 --> 00:44:39,173
Bent stingers, pointless pollination.

687
00:44:39,242 --> 00:44:41,369
Bees must hate those fake things!

688
00:44:41,444 --> 00:44:44,004
Nothing worse
than a daffodil that's had work done.

689
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:47,243
Maybe this could make up
for it a little bit.

690
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:50,184
- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
- I guess.

691
00:44:50,253 --> 00:44:52,551
You sure you want to go through with it?

692
00:44:52,622 --> 00:44:55,523
Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans, they won't be able

693
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:58,288
to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
without paying a royalty!

694
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:04,461
It's an incredible scene
here in downtown Manhattan,

695
00:45:04,534 --> 00:45:08,766
where the world anxiously waits,
because for the first time in history,

696
00:45:08,838 --> 00:45:13,798
we will hear for ourselves
if a honeybee can actually speak.

697
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:20,506
What have we gotten into here, Barry?

698
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:22,414
It's pretty big, isn't it?

699
00:45:22,485 --> 00:45:25,579
I can't believe how many humans
don't work during the day.

700
00:45:25,655 --> 00:45:29,887
You think billion-dollar multinational
food companies have good lawyers?

701
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:33,652
Everybody needs to stay
behind the barricade.

702
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:48,503
- What's the matter?
- I don't know, I just got a chill.

703
00:45:54,684 --> 00:45:57,847
Well, if it isn't the bee team.

704
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,946
You boys work on this?

705
00:46:02,959 --> 00:46:06,622
All rise! The Honorable
Judge Bumbleton presiding.

706
00:46:06,696 --> 00:46:09,324
All right. Case number 4475,

707
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:13,802
Superior Court of New York,
Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry

708
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:15,599
is now in session.

709
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:20,268
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
the five food companies collectively?

710
00:46:20,343 --> 00:46:22,140
A privilege.

711
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:27,548
Mr. Benson... you're representing
all the bees of the world?

712
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:41,364
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
we're ready to proceed.

713
00:46:43,099 --> 00:46:47,035
Mr. Montgomery,
your opening statement, please.

714
00:46:49,572 --> 00:46:52,166
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

715
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:55,336
my grandmother was a simple woman.

716
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:59,109
Born on a farm, she believed
it was man's divine right

717
00:46:59,182 --> 00:47:04,245
to benefit from the bounty
of nature God put before us.

718
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:08,416
If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
Mr. Benson imagines,

719
00:47:08,491 --> 00:47:10,254
just think of what would it mean.

720
00:47:10,326 --> 00:47:13,523
I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm

721
00:47:13,596 --> 00:47:16,861
for the elastic in my britches!

722
00:47:16,933 --> 00:47:19,026
Talking bee!

723
00:47:19,102 --> 00:47:21,593
How do we know this isn't some sort of

724
00:47:21,671 --> 00:47:25,198
holographic motion-picture-capture
Hollywood wizardry?

725
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:28,039
They could be using laser beams!

726
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:32,605
Robotics! Ventriloquism!
Cloning! For all we know,

727
00:47:32,682 --> 00:47:35,276
he could be on steroids!

728
00:47:37,086 --> 00:47:38,781
Mr. Benson?

729
00:47:44,794 --> 00:47:47,490
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's no trickery here.

730
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:51,295
I'm just an ordinary bee.
Honey's pretty important to me.

731
00:47:51,367 --> 00:47:54,165
It's important to all bees.
We invented it!

732
00:47:54,237 --> 00:47:57,400
We make it. And we protect it
with our lives.

733
00:47:57,474 --> 00:48:00,204
Unfortunately, there are
some people in this room

734
00:48:00,276 --> 00:48:02,073
who think they can take it from us

735
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:06,275
'cause we're the little guys!
I'm hoping that, after this is all over,

736
00:48:06,349 --> 00:48:10,911
you'll see how, by taking our honey,
you not only take everything we have

737
00:48:10,987 --> 00:48:12,818
but everything we are!

738
00:48:16,359 --> 00:48:19,556
I wish he'd dress like that
all the time. So nice!

739
00:48:19,629 --> 00:48:21,358
Call your first witness.

740
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:26,198
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
of Honey Farms, big company you have.

741
00:48:26,269 --> 00:48:27,600
I suppose so.

742
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:31,436
I see you also own
Honeyburton and Honron!

743
00:48:31,508 --> 00:48:34,341
Yes, they provide beekeepers
for our farms.

744
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:37,937
Beekeeper. I find that
to be a very disturbing term.

745
00:48:38,014 --> 00:48:41,950
I don't imagine you employ
any bee-free-ers, do you?

746
00:48:42,018 --> 00:48:43,952
- No.
- I couldn't hear you.

747
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:45,351
- No.
- No.

748
00:48:45,421 --> 00:48:49,084
Because you don't free bees.
You keep bees. Not only that,

749
00:48:49,158 --> 00:48:54,027
it seems you thought a bear would be
an appropriate image for a jar of honey.

750
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:56,622
They're very lovable creatures.

751
00:48:56,699 --> 00:49:00,226
Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.

752
00:49:00,303 --> 00:49:01,634
You mean like this?

753
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:07,206
Bears kill bees!

754
00:49:07,877 --> 00:49:10,971
How'd you like his head crashing
through your living room?!

755
00:49:11,047 --> 00:49:14,107
Biting into your couch!
Spitting out your throw pillows!

756
00:49:15,218 --> 00:49:17,880
OK, that's enough. Take him away.

757
00:49:23,426 --> 00:49:27,192
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
Your name intrigues me.

758
00:49:27,263 --> 00:49:31,256
- Where have I heard it before?
- I was with a band called The Police.

759
00:49:31,334 --> 00:49:33,996
But you've never been
a police officer, have you?

760
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:35,332
No, I haven't.

761
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:38,932
No, you haven't. And so here
we have yet another example

762
00:49:39,008 --> 00:49:41,340
of bee culture casually
stolen by a human

763
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:44,175
for nothing more than
a prance-about stage name.

764
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:45,509
Oh, please.

765
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:47,743
Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?

766
00:49:47,817 --> 00:49:50,684
Because I'm feeling
a little stung, Sting.

767
00:49:50,753 --> 00:49:55,247
Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!

768
00:49:56,726 --> 00:49:59,490
That's not his real name?! You idiots!

769
00:50:00,296 --> 00:50:03,629
Mr. Liotta, first,
belated congratulations on

770
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,999
your Emmy win for a guest spot
on ER in 2005.

771
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:08,935
Thank you. Thank you.

772
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:13,235
I see from your résumé
that you're devilishly handsome

773
00:50:13,309 --> 00:50:16,506
with a churning inner turmoil
that's ready to blow.

774
00:50:16,579 --> 00:50:19,047
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?

775
00:50:19,115 --> 00:50:22,380
Not yet it isn't. But is this
what it's come to for you?

776
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:24,886
Exploiting tiny, helpless bees
so you don't

777
00:50:24,954 --> 00:50:28,720
have to rehearse
your part and learn your lines, sir?

778
00:50:28,791 --> 00:50:31,316
Watch it, Benson!
I could blow right now!

779
00:50:31,394 --> 00:50:34,522
This isn't a goodfella.
This is a badfella!

780
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:39,231
Why doesn't someone just step on
this creep, and we can all go home?!

781
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:41,998
- Order in this court!
- You're all thinking it!

782
00:50:42,071 --> 00:50:43,197
Order! Order, I say!

783
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,870
- Say it!
- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!

784
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:54,879
I think it was awfully nice
of that bear to pitch in like that.

785
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:57,476
I think the jury's on our side.

786
00:50:57,987 --> 00:51:00,547
Are we doing everything right, legally?

787
00:51:00,623 --> 00:51:01,783
I'm a florist.

788
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:05,419
Right. Well, here's to a great team.

789
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:06,826
To a great team!

790
00:51:08,665 --> 00:51:10,462
Well, hello.

791
00:51:10,533 --> 00:51:12,501
- Ken!
- Hello.

792
00:51:12,568 --> 00:51:14,627
I didn't think you were coming.

793
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:19,767
No, I was just late.
I tried to call, but... the battery.

794
00:51:19,842 --> 00:51:24,108
I didn't want all this to go to waste,
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.

795
00:51:24,847 --> 00:51:27,179
Oh, that was lucky.

796
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:32,317
There's a little left.
I could heat it up.

797
00:51:32,388 --> 00:51:34,686
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.

798
00:51:38,695 --> 00:51:41,391
So I hear you're quite a tennis player.

799
00:51:41,464 --> 00:51:45,025
I'm not much for the game myself.
The ball's a little grabby.

800
00:51:46,869 --> 00:51:50,862
That's where I usually sit.
Right... there.

801
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:55,807
Ken, Barry was looking at your résumé,

802
00:51:55,878 --> 00:52:01,145
and he agreed with me that eating with
chopsticks isn't really a special skill.

803
00:52:01,217 --> 00:52:04,152
You think I don't see what you're doing?

804
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:07,883
I know how hard it is to find
the right job. We have that in common.

805
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:10,124
Do we?

806
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:14,596
Bees have 100 percent employment,
but we do jobs like taking the crud out.

807
00:52:14,664 --> 00:52:17,497
That's just what
I was thinking about doing.

808
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:22,561
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.

809
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:28,936
I'm going to drain the old stinger.

810
00:52:29,011 --> 00:52:30,740
Yeah, you do that.

811
00:52:34,083 --> 00:52:35,744
Look at that.

812
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:47,859
You know, I've just about had it

813
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:50,865
with your little mind games.

814
00:52:50,933 --> 00:52:53,458
- What's that?
- Italian Vogue.

815
00:52:53,536 --> 00:52:55,197
Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.

816
00:52:55,271 --> 00:52:56,738
A lot of ads.

817
00:52:56,806 --> 00:53:00,071
Remember what Van said, why is
your life more valuable than mine?

818
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:03,670
Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!

819
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:07,481
I think something stinks in here!

820
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:09,040
I love the smell of flowers.

821
00:53:09,118 --> 00:53:12,053
How do you like the smell of flames?!

822
00:53:12,121 --> 00:53:13,179
Not as much.

823
00:53:29,038 --> 00:53:31,063
Water bug! Not taking sides!

824
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:36,604
Ken, I'm wearing a Chapstick hat!
This is pathetic!

825
00:53:36,679 --> 00:53:38,374
I've got issues!

826
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:45,845
Well, well, well, a royal flush!

827
00:53:45,922 --> 00:53:47,913
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

828
00:53:58,501 --> 00:53:59,968
Surf's up, dude!

829
00:54:00,036 --> 00:54:01,025
Poo water!

830
00:54:04,941 --> 00:54:06,602
That bowl is gnarly.

831
00:54:06,676 --> 00:54:10,112
Except for those dirty yellow rings!

832
00:54:10,179 --> 00:54:12,613
Kenneth! What are you doing?!

833
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:16,118
You know, I don't even like honey!
I don't eat it!

834
00:54:16,185 --> 00:54:18,050
We need to talk!

835
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:20,054
He's just a little bee!

836
00:54:20,122 --> 00:54:25,116
And he happens to be
the nicest bee I've met in a long time!

837
00:54:25,194 --> 00:54:30,461
Long time? What are you talking about?!
Are there other bugs in your life?

838
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:35,470
No, but there are other things bugging
me in life. And you're one of them!

839
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:38,473
Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...

840
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:42,807
My nerves are fried from riding
on this emotional roller coaster!

841
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:44,779
Goodbye, Ken.

842
00:54:48,384 --> 00:54:50,375
And for your information,

843
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:55,720
I prefer sugar-free, artificial
sweeteners made by man!

844
00:54:56,392 --> 00:54:58,826
I'm sorry about all that.

845
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:02,558
I know it's got
an aftertaste! I like it!

846
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,533
I always felt there was some kind
of barrier between Ken and me.

847
00:55:07,603 --> 00:55:10,265
I couldn't overcome it.
Oh, well.

848
00:55:10,339 --> 00:55:12,170
Are you OK for the trial?

849
00:55:12,241 --> 00:55:15,972
I believe Mr. Montgomery
is about out of ideas.

850
00:55:16,045 --> 00:55:19,776
We would like to call
Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.

851
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:24,149
Good idea! You can really see why he's
considered one of the best lawyers...

852
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:25,780
Yeah.

853
00:55:28,157 --> 00:55:30,182
Layton, you've
gotta weave some magic

854
00:55:30,259 --> 00:55:32,523
with this jury,
or it's gonna be all over.

855
00:55:32,595 --> 00:55:36,964
Don't worry. The only thing I have
to do to turn this jury around

856
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:40,764
is to remind them
of what they don't like about bees.

857
00:55:40,836 --> 00:55:43,304
- You got the tweezers?
- Are you allergic?

858
00:55:43,372 --> 00:55:46,205
Only to losing, son. Only to losing.

859
00:55:46,275 --> 00:55:51,042
Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
what I think we'd all like to know.

860
00:55:51,113 --> 00:55:54,549
What exactly is your relationship

861
00:55:54,617 --> 00:55:56,608
to that woman?

862
00:55:57,954 --> 00:55:58,943
We're friends.

863
00:55:59,021 --> 00:56:00,318
- Good friends?
- Yes.

864
00:56:00,389 --> 00:56:03,552
How good? Do you live together?

865
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:05,093
Wait a minute...

866
00:56:05,161 --> 00:56:06,788
Are you her little...

867
00:56:07,296 --> 00:56:08,627
...bedbug?

868
00:56:09,732 --> 00:56:12,963
I've seen a bee documentary or two.
From what I understand,

869
00:56:13,035 --> 00:56:16,835
doesn't your queen give birth
to all the bee children?

870
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:19,841
- Yeah, but...
- So those aren't your real parents!

871
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:21,774
- Oh, Barry...
- Yes, they are!

872
00:56:21,844 --> 00:56:23,675
Hold me back!

873
00:56:23,746 --> 00:56:26,271
You're an illegitimate bee,
aren't you, Benson?

874
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:27,680
He's denouncing bees!

875
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:30,344
Don't y'all date your cousins?

876
00:56:30,419 --> 00:56:33,149
- Objection!
- I'm going to pincushion this guy!

877
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,220
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!

878
00:56:43,332 --> 00:56:45,596
Oh, I'm hit!

879
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:47,761
Oh, lordy, I am hit!

880
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:49,464
Order! Order!

881
00:56:49,538 --> 00:56:52,769
The venom! The venom
is coursing through my veins!

882
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:56,801
I have been felled
by a winged beast of destruction!

883
00:56:56,879 --> 00:57:01,578
You see? You can't treat them
like equals! They're striped savages!

884
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:06,212
Stinging's the only thing
they know! It's their way!

885
00:57:06,288 --> 00:57:09,018
- Adam, stay with me.
- I can't feel my legs.

886
00:57:10,359 --> 00:57:14,261
What angel of mercy
will come forward to suck the poison

887
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:16,127
from my heaving buttocks?

888
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:19,962
I will have order in this court. Order!

889
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:21,526
Order, please!

890
00:57:23,539 --> 00:57:27,407
The case of the honeybees
versus the human race

891
00:57:27,476 --> 00:57:29,740
took a pointed turn against the bees

892
00:57:29,812 --> 00:57:34,476
yesterday when one of their legal
team stung Layton T. Montgomery.

893
00:57:47,563 --> 00:57:49,497
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

894
00:57:49,565 --> 00:57:51,055
- Is there much pain?
- Yeah.

895
00:57:53,903 --> 00:57:55,200
I...

896
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:57,566
I blew the whole case, didn't I?

897
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:01,508
It doesn't matter. What matters is
you're alive. You could have died.

898
00:58:01,577 --> 00:58:04,341
I'd be better off dead. Look at me.

899
00:58:04,413 --> 00:58:09,350
They got it from the cafeteria
downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.

900
00:58:09,418 --> 00:58:12,251
Look, there's
a little celery still on it.

901
00:58:12,721 --> 00:58:14,916
What was it like to sting someone?

902
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:17,356
I can't explain it. It was all...

903
00:58:17,426 --> 00:58:20,918
All adrenaline and then...
and then ecstasy!

904
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:25,260
All right.

905
00:58:25,334 --> 00:58:27,359
You think it was all a trap?

906
00:58:27,436 --> 00:58:30,667
Of course. I'm sorry.
I flew us right into this.

907
00:58:30,739 --> 00:58:35,142
What were we thinking? Look at us. We're
just a couple of bugs in this world.

908
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:37,543
What will the humans do to us
if they win?

909
00:58:37,613 --> 00:58:38,875
I don't know.

910
00:58:38,948 --> 00:58:42,384
I hear they put the roaches in motels.
That doesn't sound so bad.

911
00:58:42,451 --> 00:58:46,046
Adam, they check in,
but they don't check out!

912
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:47,453
Oh, my.

913
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:52,553
Could you get a nurse
to close that window?

914
00:58:52,628 --> 00:58:54,596
- Why?
- The smoke.

915
00:58:54,663 --> 00:58:56,290
Bees don't smoke.

916
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:59,290
Right. Bees don't smoke.

917
00:59:00,469 --> 00:59:04,235
Bees don't smoke!
But some bees are smoking.

918
00:59:04,306 --> 00:59:06,638
That's it! That's our case!

919
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,540
It is? It's not over?

920
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:10,579
Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.

921
00:59:10,646 --> 00:59:13,638
Get back to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.

922
00:59:16,318 --> 00:59:21,153
And assuming you've done step 29
correctly, you're ready for the tub.

923
00:59:27,029 --> 00:59:28,053
Mr. Flayman.

924
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:29,995
Yes? Yes, Your Honor!

925
00:59:30,065 --> 00:59:32,761
Where is the rest of your team?

926
00:59:32,835 --> 00:59:35,201
Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.

927
00:59:35,271 --> 00:59:37,933
Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,

928
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:40,737
and as a result,
we don't make very good time.

929
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:43,605
I actually heard a funny story about...

930
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:46,113
Your Honor,
haven't these ridiculous bugs

931
00:59:46,182 --> 00:59:48,912
taken up enough
of this court's valuable time?

932
00:59:48,984 --> 00:59:53,887
How much longer will we allow
these absurd shenanigans to go on?

933
00:59:53,956 --> 00:59:58,416
They have presented no compelling
evidence to support their charges

934
00:59:58,494 --> 01:00:02,430
against my clients,
who run legitimate businesses.

935
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:06,430
I move for a complete dismissal
of this entire case!

936
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:08,799
Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going

937
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:11,271
to have to consider
Mr. Montgomery's motion.

938
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,604
But you can't! We have a terrific case.

939
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:16,338
Where is your proof?
Where is the evidence?

940
01:00:16,412 --> 01:00:19,540
Show me the smoking gun!

941
01:00:20,216 --> 01:00:22,980
Hold it, Your Honor!
You want a smoking gun?

942
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:25,714
Here is your smoking gun.

943
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:30,014
What is that?

944
01:00:30,092 --> 01:00:31,582
It's a bee smoker!

945
01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:34,652
What, this?
This harmless little contraption?

946
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:38,222
This couldn't hurt a fly,
let alone a bee.

947
01:00:44,406 --> 01:00:46,465
Look at what has happened

948
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:50,740
to bees who have never been asked,
"Smoking or non?"

949
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:52,906
Is this what nature intended for us?

950
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:55,849
To be forcibly addicted
to smoke machines

951
01:00:55,918 --> 01:00:58,352
and man-made wooden slat work camps?

952
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:03,414
Living out our lives as honey slaves
to the white man?

953
01:01:05,761 --> 01:01:09,060
- What are we gonna do?
- He's playing the species card.

954
01:01:09,598 --> 01:01:13,694
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
free these bees!

955
01:01:13,769 --> 01:01:16,294
Free the bees! Free the bees!

956
01:01:16,372 --> 01:01:18,533
Free the bees!

957
01:01:18,607 --> 01:01:21,542
Free the bees! Free the bees!

958
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:25,546
The court finds in favor of the bees!

959
01:01:25,614 --> 01:01:27,081
Vanessa, we won!

960
01:01:27,149 --> 01:01:30,175
I knew you could do it! High-five!

961
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:31,979
Sorry.

962
01:01:32,054 --> 01:01:35,387
I'm OK! You know what this means?

963
01:01:35,457 --> 01:01:37,948
All the honey
will finally belong to the bees.

964
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:40,461
Now we won't have
to work so hard all the time.

965
01:01:43,132 --> 01:01:47,728
This is an unholy perversion
of the balance of nature, Benson.

966
01:01:47,803 --> 01:01:49,464
You'll regret this.

967
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:52,732
Barry, how much honey is out there?

968
01:01:52,808 --> 01:01:54,537
All right. One at a time.

969
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:56,407
Barry, who are you wearing?

970
01:01:56,478 --> 01:01:59,208
My sweater is Ralph Lauren,
and I have no pants.

971
01:01:59,281 --> 01:02:02,114
- What if Montgomery's right?
- What do you mean?

972
01:02:02,184 --> 01:02:06,314
We've been living the bee way
a long time, 27 million years.

973
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:12,418
Congratulations on your victory.
What will you demand as a settlement?

974
01:02:12,494 --> 01:02:16,225
First, we'll demand a complete shutdown
of all bee work camps.

975
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:21,192
Then we want back the honey
that was ours to begin with,

976
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:22,897
every last drop.

977
01:02:22,971 --> 01:02:27,271
We demand an end to the glorification
of the bear as anything more

978
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:30,278
than a filthy, smelly,
bad-breath stink machine.

979
01:02:30,346 --> 01:02:33,008
We're all aware
of what they do in the woods.

980
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:35,449
Wait for my signal.

981
01:02:37,353 --> 01:02:38,581
Take him out.

982
01:02:40,589 --> 01:02:43,558
He'll have nauseous
for a few hours, then he'll be fine.

983
01:02:43,625 --> 01:02:47,061
And we will no longer tolerate
bee-negative nicknames...

984
01:02:47,129 --> 01:02:49,063
But it's just a prance-about stage name!

985
01:02:49,131 --> 01:02:52,464
...unnecessary inclusion of honey
in bogus health products

986
01:02:52,534 --> 01:02:56,698
and la-dee-da human
tea-time snack garnishments.

987
01:02:58,273 --> 01:02:59,535
Can't breathe.

988
01:03:02,044 --> 01:03:03,272
Bring it in, boys!

989
01:03:05,381 --> 01:03:07,713
Hold it right there! Good.

990
01:03:08,984 --> 01:03:10,884
Tap it.

991
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:19,223
Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,
and there's gallons more coming!

992
01:03:19,294 --> 01:03:23,162
- I think we need to shut down!
- Shut down? We've never shut down.

993
01:03:24,233 --> 01:03:26,701
Shut down honey production!

994
01:03:26,769 --> 01:03:28,634
Stop making honey!

995
01:03:33,108 --> 01:03:34,632
Turn your key, sir!

996
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:47,586
What do we do now?

997
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,421
Cannonball!

998
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:03,302
We're shutting honey production!

999
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:04,532
Mission abort.

1000
01:04:04,606 --> 01:04:08,098
Aborting pollination and nectar detail.
Returning to base.

1001
01:04:55,724 --> 01:04:58,625
Adam, you wouldn't believe
how much honey was out there.

1002
01:04:58,694 --> 01:04:59,683
Oh, yeah?

1003
01:04:59,761 --> 01:05:02,491
What's going on? Where is everybody?

1004
01:05:03,265 --> 01:05:05,756
- Are they out celebrating?
- They're home.

1005
01:05:05,834 --> 01:05:08,769
They don't know what to do.
Laying out, sleeping in.

1006
01:05:08,837 --> 01:05:12,364
I heard your Uncle Carl was on his way
to San Antonio with a cricket.

1007
01:05:12,441 --> 01:05:13,931
At least we got our honey back.

1008
01:05:14,009 --> 01:05:18,207
Sometimes I think, so what if humans
liked our honey? Who wouldn't?

1009
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:22,148
It's the greatest thing in the world!
I was excited to be part of making it.

1010
01:05:23,852 --> 01:05:28,448
This was my new desk. This was my
new job. I wanted to do it really well.

1011
01:05:28,524 --> 01:05:29,855
And now...

1012
01:05:30,692 --> 01:05:32,353
Now I can't.

1013
01:05:43,005 --> 01:05:45,473
I don't understand
why they're not happy.

1014
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:47,975
I thought their lives would be better!

1015
01:05:48,043 --> 01:05:51,911
They're doing nothing. It's amazing.
Honey really changes people.

1016
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:55,040
You don't have any idea
what's going on, do you?

1017
01:05:55,117 --> 01:05:57,779
- What did you want to show me?
- This.

1018
01:05:59,788 --> 01:06:01,085
What happened here?

1019
01:06:01,156 --> 01:06:03,886
That is not the half of it.

1020
01:06:09,565 --> 01:06:11,556
Oh, no. Oh, my.

1021
01:06:12,568 --> 01:06:14,433
They're all wilting.

1022
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:16,596
Doesn't look very good, does it?

1023
01:06:16,672 --> 01:06:18,003
No.

1024
01:06:18,073 --> 01:06:21,406
And whose fault do you think that is?

1025
01:06:23,412 --> 01:06:25,073
You know, I'm gonna guess bees.

1026
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:26,341
Bees?

1027
01:06:26,415 --> 01:06:28,349
Specifically, me.

1028
01:06:28,417 --> 01:06:32,615
I didn't think bees not needing to make
honey would affect all these things.

1029
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:37,682
It's not just flowers.
Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees.

1030
01:06:37,759 --> 01:06:40,626
That's our whole SAT test right there.

1031
01:06:40,696 --> 01:06:44,257
Take away produce, that affects
the entire animal kingdom.

1032
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:45,766
And then, of course...

1033
01:06:45,834 --> 01:06:47,597
The human species?

1034
01:06:50,839 --> 01:06:52,864
So if there's no more pollination,

1035
01:06:52,941 --> 01:06:55,739
it could all just go south here,
couldn't it?

1036
01:06:55,811 --> 01:06:59,178
I know this is also partly my fault.

1037
01:07:03,285 --> 01:07:05,446
How about a suicide pact?

1038
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,044
How do we do it?

1039
01:07:07,122 --> 01:07:10,114
- I'll sting you, you step on me.
- That just kills you twice.

1040
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:11,523
Right, right.

1041
01:07:12,127 --> 01:07:16,461
Listen, Barry...
sorry, but I gotta get going.

1042
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:26,299
I had to open my mouth and talk.

1043
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:29,641
Vanessa?

1044
01:07:32,481 --> 01:07:35,575
Vanessa? Why are you leaving?
Where are you going?

1045
01:07:35,651 --> 01:07:38,677
To the final Tournament of Roses parade
in Pasadena.

1046
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:42,690
They've moved it to this weekend
because all the flowers are dying.

1047
01:07:42,758 --> 01:07:46,194
It's the last chance
I'll ever have to see it.

1048
01:07:46,261 --> 01:07:50,721
Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
I never meant it to turn out like this.

1049
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:53,097
I know. Me neither.

1050
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:59,000
Tournament of Roses.
Roses can't do sports.

1051
01:07:59,841 --> 01:08:03,174
Wait a minute. Roses. Roses?

1052
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:05,169
Roses!

1053
01:08:05,847 --> 01:08:07,678
Vanessa!

1054
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:10,011
Roses?!

1055
01:08:10,085 --> 01:08:11,484
Barry?

1056
01:08:11,553 --> 01:08:14,613
- Roses are flowers!
- Yes, they are.

1057
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:17,716
Flowers, bees, pollen!

1058
01:08:17,793 --> 01:08:21,126
I know.
That's why this is the last parade.

1059
01:08:21,196 --> 01:08:25,257
Maybe not.
Could you ask him to slow down?

1060
01:08:25,333 --> 01:08:26,925
Could you slow down?

1061
01:08:29,571 --> 01:08:31,163
Barry!

1062
01:08:31,239 --> 01:08:34,731
OK, I made a huge mistake.
This is a total disaster, all my fault.

1063
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:36,141
Yes, it kind of is.

1064
01:08:36,211 --> 01:08:38,509
I've ruined the planet.
I wanted to help you

1065
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:40,912
with the flower shop.
I've made it worse.

1066
01:08:40,982 --> 01:08:43,416
Actually, it's completely closed down.

1067
01:08:43,485 --> 01:08:45,419
I thought maybe you were remodeling.

1068
01:08:45,487 --> 01:08:49,753
But I have another idea, and it's
greater than my previous ideas combined.

1069
01:08:49,825 --> 01:08:51,622
I don't want to hear it!

1070
01:08:52,561 --> 01:08:56,554
All right, they have the roses,
the roses have the pollen.

1071
01:08:56,631 --> 01:08:59,828
I know every bee, plant
and flower bud in this park.

1072
01:08:59,901 --> 01:09:03,496
All we gotta do is get what they've got
back here with what we've got.

1073
01:09:03,572 --> 01:09:04,698
- Bees.
- Park.

1074
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:05,933
- Pollen!
- Flowers.

1075
01:09:06,007 --> 01:09:08,976
- Repollination!
- Across the nation!

1076
01:09:09,411 --> 01:09:12,574
Tournament of Roses,
Pasadena, California.

1077
01:09:12,647 --> 01:09:15,639
They've got nothing
but flowers, floats and cotton candy.

1078
01:09:15,717 --> 01:09:17,014
Security will be tight.

1079
01:09:17,085 --> 01:09:18,848
I have an idea.

1080
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:20,387
Vanessa Bloome, FTD.

1081
01:09:20,455 --> 01:09:23,117
Official floral business. It's real.

1082
01:09:23,191 --> 01:09:25,591
Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch.

1083
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:27,321
Thank you. It was a gift.

1084
01:09:28,263 --> 01:09:31,096
Once inside,
we just pick the right float.

1085
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:34,261
How about The Princess and the Pea?

1086
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:37,271
I could be the princess,
and you could be the pea!

1087
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:38,601
Yes, I got it.

1088
01:09:40,442 --> 01:09:42,706
- Where should I sit?
- What are you?

1089
01:09:42,778 --> 01:09:44,643
- I believe I'm the pea.
- The pea?

1090
01:09:44,713 --> 01:09:46,374
It goes under the mattresses.

1091
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:49,212
- Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart.
- I'm getting the marshal.

1092
01:09:49,284 --> 01:09:52,276
You do that!
This whole parade is a fiasco!

1093
01:09:54,556 --> 01:09:56,353
Let's see what this baby'll do.

1094
01:09:57,893 --> 01:10:00,054
Hey, what are you doing?!

1095
01:10:01,296 --> 01:10:03,958
Then all we do
is blend in with traffic...

1096
01:10:04,499 --> 01:10:06,626
...without arousing suspicion.

1097
01:10:09,304 --> 01:10:12,239
Once at the airport,
there's no stopping us.

1098
01:10:12,307 --> 01:10:13,296
Stop! Security.

1099
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:15,570
- You and your insect pack your float?
- Yes.

1100
01:10:15,644 --> 01:10:18,169
Has it been
in your possession the entire time?

1101
01:10:18,246 --> 01:10:20,544
Would you remove your shoes?

1102
01:10:20,615 --> 01:10:22,913
- Remove your stinger.
- It's part of me.

1103
01:10:22,984 --> 01:10:26,181
I know. Just having some fun.
Enjoy your flight.

1104
01:10:32,327 --> 01:10:36,161
Then if we're lucky, we'll have
just enough pollen to do the job.

1105
01:10:37,299 --> 01:10:41,133
Can you believe how lucky we are? We
have just enough pollen to do the job!

1106
01:10:41,203 --> 01:10:42,795
I think this is gonna work.

1107
01:10:42,871 --> 01:10:43,963
It's got to work.

1108
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:46,667
Attention, passengers,
this is Captain Scott.

1109
01:10:46,741 --> 01:10:49,039
We have a bit of bad weather
in New York.

1110
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:51,806
It looks like we'll experience
a couple hours delay.

1111
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:55,873
Barry, these are cut flowers
with no water. They'll never make it.

1112
01:10:55,951 --> 01:10:58,044
I gotta get up there
and talk to them.

1113
01:10:58,119 --> 01:10:59,381
Be careful.

1114
01:11:02,057 --> 01:11:04,548
Can I get help
with the Sky Mall magazine?

1115
01:11:04,626 --> 01:11:08,118
I'd like to order the talking
inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.

1116
01:11:12,567 --> 01:11:14,558
Captain, I'm in a real situation.

1117
01:11:14,636 --> 01:11:16,661
- What'd you say, Hal?
- Nothing.

1118
01:11:16,738 --> 01:11:18,103
Bee!

1119
01:11:18,173 --> 01:11:20,300
Don't freak out! My entire species...

1120
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:26,911
What are you doing?

1121
01:11:31,653 --> 01:11:34,679
- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!
- Who's an attorney?

1122
01:11:34,756 --> 01:11:36,553
Don't move.

1123
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:42,185
Oh, Barry.

1124
01:11:43,265 --> 01:11:46,063
Good afternoon, passengers.
This is your captain.

1125
01:11:46,134 --> 01:11:50,537
Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B
please report to the cockpit?

1126
01:11:50,605 --> 01:11:52,266
And please hurry!

1127
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:56,410
What happened here?

1128
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:59,777
There was a DustBuster,
a toupee, a life raft exploded.

1129
01:11:59,848 --> 01:12:02,942
One's bald, one's in a boat,
they're both unconscious!

1130
01:12:03,785 --> 01:12:05,514
- Is that another bee joke?
- No!

1131
01:12:05,587 --> 01:12:07,214
No one's flying the plane!

1132
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:11,487
This is JFK control tower, Flight 356.
What's your status?

1133
01:12:11,559 --> 01:12:14,892
This is Vanessa Bloome.
I'm a florist from New York.

1134
01:12:14,963 --> 01:12:16,157
Where's the pilot?

1135
01:12:16,231 --> 01:12:18,722
He's unconscious,
and so is the copilot.

1136
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:22,031
Not good. Does anyone onboard
have flight experience?

1137
01:12:22,103 --> 01:12:23,730
As a matter of fact, there is.

1138
01:12:23,805 --> 01:12:25,739
- Who's that?
- Barry Benson.

1139
01:12:25,807 --> 01:12:28,105
From the honey trial?! Oh, great.

1140
01:12:28,176 --> 01:12:30,736
Vanessa, this is nothing more
than a big metal bee.

1141
01:12:30,812 --> 01:12:32,837
It's got giant wings, huge engines.

1142
01:12:32,914 --> 01:12:34,211
I can't fly a plane.

1143
01:12:34,282 --> 01:12:36,614
- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?
- Yes.

1144
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:38,380
How hard could it be?

1145
01:12:39,721 --> 01:12:42,417
Wait, Barry!
We're headed into some lightning.

1146
01:12:45,493 --> 01:12:49,520
This is Bob Bumble. We have some
late-breaking news from JFK Airport,

1147
01:12:49,597 --> 01:12:52,430
where a suspenseful scene
is developing.

1148
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:55,196
Barry Benson,
fresh from his legal victory...

1149
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:56,430
That's Barry!

1150
01:12:56,504 --> 01:12:59,996
...is attempting to land a plane,
loaded with people, flowers

1151
01:13:00,075 --> 01:13:02,305
and an incapacitated flight crew.

1152
01:13:02,377 --> 01:13:03,435
Flowers?!

1153
01:13:03,511 --> 01:13:07,607
We have a storm in the area
and two individuals at the controls

1154
01:13:07,682 --> 01:13:10,412
with absolutely no flight experience.

1155
01:13:10,485 --> 01:13:12,919
Just a minute.
There's a bee on that plane.

1156
01:13:12,988 --> 01:13:17,448
I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson
and his no-account compadres.

1157
01:13:17,525 --> 01:13:19,493
They've done enough damage.

1158
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:21,085
But isn't he your only hope?

1159
01:13:21,162 --> 01:13:23,960
Technically, a bee
shouldn't be able to fly at all.

1160
01:13:24,032 --> 01:13:25,966
Their wings are too small...

1161
01:13:26,034 --> 01:13:28,400
Haven't we heard this a million times?

1162
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:31,837
"The surface area of the wings
and body mass make no sense. "

1163
01:13:31,906 --> 01:13:34,238
- Get this on the air!
- Got it.

1164
01:13:34,309 --> 01:13:36,106
- Stand by.
- We're going live.

1165
01:13:37,045 --> 01:13:39,980
The way we work may be a mystery to you.

1166
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:43,108
Making honey takes a lot of bees
doing a lot of small jobs.

1167
01:13:43,184 --> 01:13:45,311
But let me tell you about a small job.

1168
01:13:45,387 --> 01:13:48,254
If you do it well,
it makes a big difference.

1169
01:13:48,323 --> 01:13:51,258
More than we realized.
To us, to everyone.

1170
01:13:51,326 --> 01:13:54,818
That's why I want to get bees
back to working together.

1171
01:13:54,896 --> 01:13:58,423
That's the bee way!
We're not made of Jell-O.

1172
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:00,331
We get behind a fellow.

1173
01:14:00,402 --> 01:14:02,734
- Black and yellow!
- Hello!

1174
01:14:06,674 --> 01:14:08,198
Left, right, down, hover.

1175
01:14:08,276 --> 01:14:09,834
- Hover?
- Forget hover.

1176
01:14:09,911 --> 01:14:12,471
This isn't so hard.
Beep-beep! Beep-beep!

1177
01:14:15,583 --> 01:14:17,346
Barry, what happened?!

1178
01:14:17,419 --> 01:14:20,354
Wait, I think we were
on autopilot the whole time.

1179
01:14:20,422 --> 01:14:23,482
- That may have been helping me.
- And now we're not!

1180
01:14:23,558 --> 01:14:26,152
So it turns out I cannot fly a plane.

1181
01:14:29,464 --> 01:14:34,197
All of you, let's get
behind this fellow! Move it out!

1182
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:35,964
Move out!

1183
01:14:43,845 --> 01:14:47,838
Our only chance is if I do what I'd do,
you copy me with the wings of the plane!

1184
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:48,940
Don't have to yell.

1185
01:14:49,017 --> 01:14:51,542
I'm not yelling!
We're in a lot of trouble.

1186
01:14:51,619 --> 01:14:55,214
It's very hard to concentrate
with that panicky tone in your voice!

1187
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:58,123
It's not a tone. I'm panicking!

1188
01:15:09,003 --> 01:15:10,129
I can't do this!

1189
01:15:10,205 --> 01:15:13,732
Vanessa, pull yourself together.
You have to snap out of it!

1190
01:15:13,808 --> 01:15:16,168
You snap out of it.

1191
01:15:16,244 --> 01:15:21,140
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

1192
01:15:41,269 --> 01:15:43,567
- You snap out of it!
- You snap out of it!

1193
01:15:43,638 --> 01:15:46,232
- Hold it!
- Why? Come on, it's my turn.

1194
01:15:46,307 --> 01:15:48,434
How is the plane flying?

1195
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:49,670
I don't know.

1196
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:51,536
Hello?

1197
01:15:51,613 --> 01:15:54,605
Benson, got any flowers
for a happy occasion in there?

1198
01:15:54,682 --> 01:15:56,115
The Pollen Jocks!

1199
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:57,811
They do get behind a fellow.

1200
01:15:57,886 --> 01:16:00,320
- Black and yellow.
- Hello.

1201
01:16:00,388 --> 01:16:03,380
All right, let's drop this tin can
on the blacktop.

1202
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:05,949
Where? I can't see anything. Can you?

1203
01:16:06,027 --> 01:16:08,325
No, nothing. It's all cloudy.

1204
01:16:08,396 --> 01:16:10,626
Come on. You got to think bee, Barry.

1205
01:16:10,698 --> 01:16:12,791
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

1206
01:16:12,867 --> 01:16:16,166
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

1207
01:16:16,237 --> 01:16:19,070
Wait a minute.
I think I'm feeling something.

1208
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:21,768
- What?
- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.

1209
01:16:21,843 --> 01:16:24,175
Like a 27-million-year-old instinct.

1210
01:16:24,245 --> 01:16:25,542
Bring the nose down.

1211
01:16:28,483 --> 01:16:31,975
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

1212
01:16:32,053 --> 01:16:36,149
- What in the world is on the tarmac?
- Get some lights on that!

1213
01:16:36,224 --> 01:16:40,092
Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

1214
01:16:40,161 --> 01:16:42,493
- Vanessa, aim for the flower.
- OK.

1215
01:16:42,564 --> 01:16:46,694
Cut the engines. We're going in
on bee power. Ready, boys?

1216
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:47,792
Affirmative!

1217
01:16:50,738 --> 01:16:53,263
Good. Good. Easy, now. That's it.

1218
01:16:53,341 --> 01:16:55,002
Land on that flower!

1219
01:16:55,076 --> 01:16:56,668
Ready? Full reverse!

1220
01:16:56,744 --> 01:16:57,904
Spin it around!

1221
01:17:01,115 --> 01:17:03,140
- Not that flower! The other one!
- Which one?

1222
01:17:03,218 --> 01:17:05,584
- That flower.
- I'm aiming at the flower!

1223
01:17:05,653 --> 01:17:10,283
That's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.
I mean the giant pulsating flower

1224
01:17:10,358 --> 01:17:13,191
made of millions of bees!

1225
01:17:13,261 --> 01:17:16,253
Pull forward. Nose down. Tail up.

1226
01:17:16,931 --> 01:17:18,592
Rotate around it.

1227
01:17:19,133 --> 01:17:22,625
- This is insane, Barry!
- This's the only way I know how to fly.

1228
01:17:22,704 --> 01:17:26,731
Am I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane
flying in an insect-like pattern?

1229
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:30,209
Get your nose in there. Don't be afraid.
Smell it. Full reverse!

1230
01:17:30,278 --> 01:17:32,337
Just drop it. Be a part of it.

1231
01:17:32,947 --> 01:17:34,915
Aim for the center!

1232
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:37,952
Now drop it in! Drop it in, woman!

1233
01:17:48,229 --> 01:17:49,890
Come on, already.

1234
01:17:54,702 --> 01:17:58,229
Barry, we did it!
You taught me how to fly!

1235
01:17:58,306 --> 01:18:00,774
- Yes. No high-five!
- Right.

1236
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:03,743
Barry, it worked!
Did you see the giant flower?

1237
01:18:03,811 --> 01:18:08,305
What giant flower? Where? Of course
I saw the flower! That was genius!

1238
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:10,908
- Thank you.
- But we're not done yet.

1239
01:18:19,994 --> 01:18:21,120
Listen, everyone!

1240
01:18:21,195 --> 01:18:24,096
This runway is covered
with the last pollen

1241
01:18:24,165 --> 01:18:26,929
from the last flowers
available anywhere on Earth.

1242
01:18:27,001 --> 01:18:30,095
That means this is our last chance.

1243
01:18:30,171 --> 01:18:34,767
We're the only ones who make honey,
pollinate flowers and dress like this.

1244
01:18:34,842 --> 01:18:39,404
If we're gonna survive as a species,
this is our moment! What do you say?

1245
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:44,713
Are we going to be bees, or just
Museum of Natural History keychains?

1246
01:18:44,786 --> 01:18:46,344
We're bees!

1247
01:18:46,421 --> 01:18:47,581
Keychain!

1248
01:18:47,655 --> 01:18:51,455
Then follow me! Except Keychain.

1249
01:18:51,526 --> 01:18:53,460
Hold on, Barry. Here.

1250
01:18:53,528 --> 01:18:55,018
You've earned this.

1251
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:03,598
Yeah!

1252
01:19:06,374 --> 01:19:11,368
I'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect
fit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.

1253
01:19:15,216 --> 01:19:16,478
Oh, yeah.

1254
01:19:16,551 --> 01:19:18,781
That's our Barry.

1255
01:20:28,289 --> 01:20:30,120
Mom! The bees are back!

1256
01:20:43,304 --> 01:20:45,772
If anybody needs
to make a call, now's the time.

1257
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:48,308
I got a feeling we'll be
working late tonight!

1258
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:07,751
Here's your change. Have a great
afternoon! Can I help who's next?

1259
01:21:07,829 --> 01:21:12,596
Would you like some honey with that?
It is bee-approved. Don't forget these.

1260
01:21:12,667 --> 01:21:17,001
Milk, cream, cheese, it's all me.
And I don't see a nickel!

1261
01:21:18,206 --> 01:21:20,970
Sometimes I just feel
like a piece of meat!

1262
01:21:21,042 --> 01:21:22,304
I had no idea.

1263
01:21:22,376 --> 01:21:24,844
Barry, I'm sorry.
Have you got a moment?

1264
01:21:24,912 --> 01:21:28,109
Would you excuse me?
My mosquito associate will help you.

1265
01:21:28,182 --> 01:21:29,376
Sorry I'm late.

1266
01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:30,576
He's a lawyer too?

1267
01:21:30,651 --> 01:21:35,486
I was already a blood-sucking parasite.
All I needed was a briefcase.

1268
01:21:35,556 --> 01:21:37,387
Have a great afternoon!

1269
01:21:37,458 --> 01:21:41,656
Barry, I just got this huge tulip order,
and I can't get them anywhere.

1270
01:21:41,729 --> 01:21:44,095
No problem, Vannie.
Just leave it to me.

1271
01:21:44,165 --> 01:21:46,963
You're a lifesaver, Barry.
Can I help who's next?

1272
01:21:47,034 --> 01:21:50,162
All right, scramble, jocks!
It's time to fly.

1273
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:52,035
Thank you, Barry!

1274
01:21:54,709 --> 01:21:57,075
That bee is living my life!

1275
01:21:57,144 --> 01:21:58,270
Let it go, Kenny.

1276
01:21:58,346 --> 01:22:00,940
- When will this nightmare end?!
- Let it all go.

1277
01:22:07,054 --> 01:22:09,488
- Beautiful day to fly.
- Sure is.

1278
01:22:09,557 --> 01:22:13,323
Between you and me,
I was dying to get out of that office.

1279
01:29:42,509 --> 01:29:45,342
You have got
to start thinking bee, my friend.

1280
01:29:45,412 --> 01:29:47,209
- Thinking bee!
- Me?

1281
01:30:21,882 --> 01:30:24,646
Hold it. Let's just stop
for a second. Hold it.

1282
01:30:24,718 --> 01:30:28,313
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.
Can we stop here?

1283
01:30:28,389 --> 01:30:31,825
I'm not making a major life decision
during a production number!

1284
01:30:31,892 --> 01:30:34,986
All right. Take ten, everybody.
Wrap it up, guys.

1285
01:30:35,062 --> 01:30:37,189
I had virtually no rehearsal for that.
